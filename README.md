# Everything that really should be in CoreFoundation, but isn't.

Consider FoundationKit CoreFoundation's big brother.  We add lots of useful categories, helpers, classes and macros.

It's both for iOS4.0 upwards and Mac OS 10.6+. (Its' a project, and you include the lib you need)

It's still very much work in progress, so don't yet use it in production. If you start a new app today, it's the perfect time to begin with it.
